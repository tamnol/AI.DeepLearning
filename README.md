# DeepLearning-AI
##This repository contents sample project codes to solve real-world Marchine learning problems.
every file (Filename.ipynb) was written using Google colab environment that utilizes( Tensorflow, Keras, Mathplotlib, Numpy, Panda, 
seaborn...) to implement each a single Artificial Neural Network(NN) solution.
